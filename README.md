## Hello World Java

This is a demo hello world witch development environment setup instructions!  

To run the code, first it needs to be compiled with the java development kit, then it needs to be run with the java runtime environment.  

## Development

### Writing Code

The HelloWorld.java file contains the source code.  You can edit it with any text editor with nice highlighting.  Eclipse is popular in the java development world.  Java is a type heavy language, so vim isn't as handy with java as it is in other areas without installing plugins to automate some of the verbosity needed.  
### Compiling Code

The command to compile the HelloWorld.java source code is
```
$ javac -g HelloWorld.java
```

But you need to install the javac binary on your system, which is found in the java development kit.  To install on linux, use the command:

```
$  sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
```


### Decompiling Analysing Code

Because java is a compiled language, it's compiled output needs to be investigating.  To do this run the below command:

```
$ TODO
```
